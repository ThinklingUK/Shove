        <p>There are <b>{0, number, integer} beds</b> marked out across the board and a vertical line on each side.</p>
        <p>Each player has a turn sliding their <b>{1, number, integer} coins</b> up the board with the aim of coins ending in a bed to score.</p>
        <p>A coin that does not reach the first bed may be replayed.</p>
        <p>At the end of a player''s turn, any valid scores are added to that player''s score for the bed.</p>
        <p>Once they have a total score of <b>{2, number, integer} for a bed</b>, that bed is considered filled.</p>
        <p>If the bed has already been filled, that bed''s scores will go to the opponent (unless doing so would cause a win).</p>
